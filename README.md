## Different ways of CSS Styling
There are many ways to do CSS styling, nevertheless this sections only covers the difference between the following styles:
- Styled-Components
- SASS
- Emotion Styled
- Tailwind-CSS

### Styled-Components (Preferred way of styling)
Advantages:
- Easy maninenance. Dont need to hunt across different files to find the styling affecting your components.
- No classname bugs. It generate unique classnames for your styles. Wont have to worry about duplication, overlap
- Dynamic styling. Adapting the styling of a component based on its props or a global theme is simple and intuitive without having to manually manage dozens of classes.
- Easier deletion of CSS. Every bits of styling is tied to a specific components so if the componenets is unused and it get deleted.All its styles will also get deleted with it
- Able to write CSS to current standard & styled-components will handle the rest.
- It keep tracks of which components are rendered on the page and injects their styles and nothing else. Thus, it load the least amount of code neccesary.

#### Adapting based on props:
#### Extending Styles:
Quite frequently you might want to use a component, but change it slightly for a single case. Now, you could pass in an interpolated function and change them based on some props, but that's quite a lot of effort for overriding the styles once.
